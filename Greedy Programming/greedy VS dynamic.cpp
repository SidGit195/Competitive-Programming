/* 
    Greedy method and dynamic method both are used for solving optimization problem both have different stategies but purpose is same 

    optimization problem are those problem which required either maximum or minimum result


    In GREEDY method we try to follow predefined processor to obtain optimize result
    the processor is known to be optimal, we follow the processor to get the best result

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    But in DYNAMIC programming, we try to find out all possible solution then pick-up the best solution / optimal solution
    this approach is different and it's little time consuming compare to greedy problem

    DYNAMIC programming follow the Principal of optimility
    ------------------------------
    Principal of optimility
    (min + max) problem  ------->  this is a optimization problem  --->  the problem can be solved using dynamic problem

    principal of optamility says a problem can be solved in sequence of decisions
